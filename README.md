## Anagrams

By Brooke Perry

_This site was created as the Ruby Week 1 Independent Project. The purpose of this project is practice testing by writing a program that determines whether two words or phrases are anagrams :_


### Specs
 * Only letters are evaluated
   * All non letter characters are removed
   * Casing is insensitive
 * All words must contain a vowel
 * If words are anagrams, output: "Words are anagrams!"
 * If one or both words do NOT contain a vowel, output: "Both words must contain a vowel"
 * If words do NOT contain any matching letters, output: "Words are antigrams!"
 * If words have matching letters, but are not anagrams, output: "These are not anagrams, but have matching letters: ..."
 * Example input: Tea, Eat
  * Expected output: "Words are anagrams!"  
 * Example input: Hobbit, Dwarf
  * Expected output: "Words are antigrams!"
 * Example input: Danger, Enrage
  * Expected output: "These are not anagrams, but have matching letters: a e g n r"
